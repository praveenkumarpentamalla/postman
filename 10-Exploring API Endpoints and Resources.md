# **Chapter 10: Exploring API Endpoints and Resources**

## **10.1 Querying a Data Endpoint**

APIs provide access to data through specific addresses known as endpoints. After verifying the API's status, the next logical step is to retrieve its primary data. In this case, we will query the `/products` endpoint to retrieve a list of available items from the grocery store inventory.

## **10.2 Constructing the Request**

1.  **Identify the Endpoint:** The API documentation specifies the endpoint `/products` for retrieving all products.
2.  **Build the URL:** Combine the `{{baseURL}}` variable with the new endpoint path: `{{baseURL}}/products`.
3.  **Save the Request:** A new request must be saved to the existing collection (`Simple Grocery Store API`) to inherit and correctly resolve the `baseURL` variable. Name the request descriptively (e.g., "Get All Products").
4.  **Send the Request:** Execute the request. A successful response will have a **200 OK** status code.

## **10.3 Interpreting the Response**

The data returned by the API is found in the **Response Body**. For the `/products` endpoint, the body contains a list of products.

*   **Data Format:** The response is formatted in **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation), which is the standard data interchange format for most web APIs.
*   **Reading JSON:** Even without deep knowledge of JSON syntax, the data is human-readable. It consists of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces `{}`, and lists are contained within square brackets `[]`.
*   **Data Structure:** Each product in the list contains attributes such as:
    *   `id`: A unique identifier for the product.
    *   `category`: The type of product (e.g., "coffee", "fresh produce").
    *   `name`: The display name of the product (e.g., "Starbucks Coffee Variety Pack").

## **10.4 Key Terminology**

*   **Endpoint:** The specific path in a URL that corresponds to a particular function or dataset provided by the API (e.g., `/status`, `/products`). It is the "address" you send a request to.
*   **Resource:** A piece of data or an object that the API manages (e.g., a single product, the list of all products, a user account). Endpoints are the means to access these resources.
*   **URL (Uniform Resource Locator):** The complete address used to locate and access a resource on the internet. It is composed of the base URL and the endpoint path.
*   **REST API:** A architectural style for designing networked applications. REST APIs provide access to "resources" (data objects) via standardized URLs and HTTP methods.

### **Key Concepts**

*   **Endpoint:** A specific path on a server that an API exposes for performing a specific operation or accessing a specific resource.
*   **Resource:** Any data object or service that can be accessed and manipulated via the API.
*   **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):** A lightweight, text-based data format uses key-value pairs and arrays to structure data. It is the primary language for data exchange in web APIs.

### **Key Takeaways**

*   Different **endpoints** provide access to different **resources** and functionalities within an API.
*   The **response body** contains the core data payload returned by the server, typically in **JSON** format.
*   JSON structures data in a human-readable way using key-value pairs, even for those new to the format.
*   A **REST API** structures its endpoints around **nouns** (resources) like `/products` or `/users`, rather than **actions**.
*   Always **save new requests to the relevant collection** to ensure variables (like `baseURL`) are resolved correctly.
