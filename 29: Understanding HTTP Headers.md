# **Chapter 29: Understanding HTTP Headers**

## **29.1 The Role of Headers**

HTTP headers are essential components of both requests and responses. They convey metadata—information *about* the request or response itself—rather than the actual data payload. Headers are fundamental to how HTTP communication works.

## **29.2 Viewing Headers in Postman**

Postman automatically manages many headers for you. To view them:

*   **Request Headers:** Navigate to the **Headers** tab below the address bar. Postman may hide automatically generated headers; click the message (e.g., "10 hidden") to reveal them all.
*   **Response Headers:** After sending a request, check the **Headers** tab in the response section to see the headers returned by the server.

## **29.3 Common and Critical Headers**

Headers are key-value pairs. Some of the most important ones include:

*   **`Content-Type` (Request):** Tells the server the format of the data in the request body (e.g., `application/json`). Postman sets this automatically when you choose `JSON` in the Body tab.
*   **`Content-Type` (Response):** Tells the client (Postman) the format of the data in the response body. Postman uses this to determine how to display the response (e.g., in the "Pretty" view for JSON).
*   **`Authorization`:** Contains credentials to authenticate a client to a server (e.g., `Bearer <token>`). This is often configured via Postman's Authorization tab, which automatically populates this header.

## **29.4 Adding and Managing Headers Manually**

While Postman auto-generates many headers, you may need to add custom ones.

**To Add a Custom Header:**
1.  In the **Headers** tab, find the empty row at the bottom of the list.
2.  Enter the header **Key** (e.g., `X-Custom-Header`).
3.  Enter the header **Value** (e.g., `custom-value`).

**To Override an Auto-Generated Header:**
You cannot directly edit the auto-generated headers. To override one:
1.  Manually add a new header in the list with the **exact same key** as the one you wish to override (e.g., `Content-Type`).
2.  Set your desired value. Postman will use your manually defined value and ignore the auto-generated one for that key.

**Special Case – Authorization Header:** Headers set via the **Authorization tab** take precedence. To use a manually defined `Authorization` header, you must first set the Authorization type to **"No Auth"** or **"Inherit auth from parent"** in the Authorization tab.

## **29.5 Header Precedence**

If multiple headers with the same key exist, Postman uses the following precedence order (highest to lowest):
1.  Headers defined in the **Headers tab**.
2.  Headers set by **scripts** (a more advanced feature).
3.  Headers auto-generated by Postman based on request configuration (e.g., setting the Body to JSON auto-adds `Content-Type: application/json`).

### **Key Concepts**

*   **HTTP Header:** A key-value pair that provides contextual information about an HTTP request or response.
*   **Metadata:** Data that provides information about other data. Headers are metadata about the HTTP message.
*   **`Content-Type`:** A header that indicates the media type of the associated body content.

***
### **Key Takeaways**

*   Headers carry **metadata** about the HTTP message, such as content type and authentication.
*   Postman **automatically generates** many necessary headers (like `Content-Type`) based on your request configuration.
*   You can **view all headers**—both sent and received—in the respective **Headers tabs**.
*   To **override an auto-generated header**, manually add a header with the same key in the Headers tab.
*   The **Authorization tab** is the preferred way to manage authentication headers, as it handles the complex formatting (e.g., `Bearer` prefix) for you.
